Q1: https://github.com/flyrobot27/syheung-CMPUT404-Lab4
Q2: A default Django landing page
Q3: when navigating to /, a 404 error is shown. When navigating to /polls, the "Hello world" index is shown.
Q4: Migration is used for propagating changes to the schema into the database. In this case SQLite is used.
Q5: We can see user and group management as well as the models we've added. We need to add our models in admin.py in order for it to appear
Q6: The text "You're looking at question 38" is displayed. 
    When going to /polls/38/results and /polls/38/vote, the corresponding "You're looking at the results of question 38" and "You're voting on question 38" is displayed.
    If we didn't put a number, a 404 error is displayed. 
    We can set the data type in path() to be str instead. e.g. <str:question_id>/results/
Q7: It is for easier code maintenance. For example, if the path of the data is changed, we only need to change it in the code.
Q8: generic views makes writing it a lot simplier and less verbose. 
    However if there are a lot of complex logic behind the view, then generic view might not be up to the task
